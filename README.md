Some random small games I made.

DICE ROLL
Code I wrote that takes in m dice and rolls them m times.
It can return a list of all the rolls, frequency of the values rolled, and a histogram.

GUESS NUMBER
A small game, just guess the number!

RANDOM WALK
Code similar to DICE ROLL but is based on a random step of either moving forward or backward.
